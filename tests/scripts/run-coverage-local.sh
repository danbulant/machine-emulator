# Run the coverage pipeline locally, outside the coverage Docker image.
#
# This reproduces what CI does in the "coverage" job. It works on Linux
# (gcc) and macOS (clang/llvm-cov); the toolchain picks GCOV automatically.
#
# Docker must be running: the *-with-toolchain test builds and the uarch PC
# resolution in coverage-report run through `make toolchain-exec`. Everything
# else builds natively.
#
# Native dependencies:
#   Linux (apt): build-essential gcc g++ gcovr libomp-dev libboost-dev
#     libssl-dev libslirp-dev lua5.4 liblua5.4-dev lua-socket lua-lpeg
#     luarocks xxd pkg-config stress-ng
#   macOS (macports): clang gcovr boost openssl libslirp lua54 luarocks
#     pkgconfig stress-ng (llvm provides llvm-cov)
#   luarocks (both): luacov cluacov luaposix
#     (luarocks --lua-version 5.4 install <pkg>)
#
# You must have already initialized submodules:
#   git submodule update --init --recursive
#
# Usage:
#   cd emulator
#   tests/scripts/run-coverage-local.sh [--skip-build] [--skip-tests]
#
# Output:
#   tests/build/coverage/         HTML report and summary
